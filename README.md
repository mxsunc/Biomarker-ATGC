This repository is an updated version of https://github.com/BarasLab/ATGC/tree/method_paper. We applied its multiple instance learning model (MIL) on sometic mutations to predict oncological biomarkers, such as microsatellite instability and homologous recombination deficiency. Furthermore, we compared it to a classical machine learning (ML) model. Results showed that MIL outperformed the ML model, especially when applying to sparse data.
